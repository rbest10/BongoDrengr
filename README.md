AIO Media Edior

This started as a boredom-fueled experiment—a "what if?" project to see how far I could push things. Turns out, way further than I expected. What began as a casual tinker ballooned into a full-blown obsession (fueled by more coffee than I’d care to admit). What you’re seeing now? Just a fraction of what’s planned… though progress hit a massive speed bump.

In a sleep-deprived haze—think 3 AM, empty snack bags, and cursing at Xcode.....I nuked the entire Models folder(thining its the AiModels folder...because this was giving me issues). Thank, Apple, for making deletions truly permanent. Two days of frantic Googling, testing every "miracle" recovery tool (none worked), and finally accepting defeat.

Now I’m manually reconstructing every model file, or trying to .....a tedious process made slower by my Swift newbie status. Silver lining? I’ve learned more about Swift than I initially came in knowing. Turns out, nothing beats getting your hands dirty. Most core features work, so I’m releasing this as a "preview" while I rebuild properly. Full update coming once I’ve either:

Restored everything (last backup: Last Month) or
Lose my mind and redo everything.

Is this app revolutionary? Kinda, maybe, not really. But it’s a twist on existing ideas, and proof that a little curiosity + stubbornness + AI can turn "what if?" into "holy crap, it works!".

Lessons Learned (The Hard Way):

Backups. Backups. BACKUPS.Backupsssssssss
CoreML giveth, and CoreML taketh away.
More soon. Or maybe not because I'm still pisseed at myself. 

I did try to upload this to sourceforge and gitlens, so as to follow rules, yet the files are to large. I also tried gitlens.
